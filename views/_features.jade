          | Jeet is built on CSS preprocessors. It's capable of doing a lot of programatic calculations that CSS can't. As such, you're no longer limited to classes like 
          code .col-6
          | . Instead, you can pass
          span.italic  any
          |  fraction, decimal, or combination of the two, to create a completely custom grid.

        p Jeet is famous for being the fastest grid system in the world. It's easy to read, terse, syntax (e.g. 
          code col(1/3)
          | ) allows you to craft a completely custom structure to your site literally in minutes.
