Jeet 3
---

Refer to http://jeetframework.com for usage docs.

Installation
---

1. Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
1. `npm install -g stylus axis-css`
1. `cd ~/your_empty_project_directory`
1. `git clone https://github.com/CorySimmons/jeet.git .`
1. `./watch`
1. Hack away at `index.html` and `css/custom.styl`

Note
---

We're currently working on another npm package and will be expanding on the doc with screencasts and such. To be honest, I just wanted to start using Jeet 3 for a few personal projects of mine. Jeet 2 is still available under the [Jeet2 branch](https://github.com/CorySimmons/jeet/tree/jeet2) so you can download it and use `jeet watch` in those project directories.

Also, we're dropping support for SCSS but I expect someone ([@ozamorowski](https://github.com/ozamorowski)) will fork/port Jeet 3 sooner than later.
