Moving Parts

- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
- [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)

- [boxsizing.htc](https://github.com/Schepp/box-sizing-polyfill) (so Box-Sizing works in IE browsers)
- Heavy customization stuff to make it all work seamlessly together


FAQ
=

**Q** Where can I ask Jeet related questions?

**A** Several places! The fastest way is to Tweet [@jeetframework](http://twitter.com/jeetframework); if you're not in a hurry, it'd be nice if you posted questions on Stack Overlow under the [CSS-Frameworks tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/css-frameworks); if you believe there's an underlying bug or problem with the framework, open or comment on an issue at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CorySimmons/jeet/issues).


**Q** Why "Jeet"?

**A** Named after Bruce Lee's, Jeet Kune Do. Mr. Lee combined the best of every martial art into his own fighting style. Jeet Framework does the same by taking the best parts and leaving out the bloat.


**Q** Goals for this project?

**A** I'd like to continue fixing bugs as they pop up, and implement as many feature requests as possible until this framework rules them all. Leave suggestions in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CorySimmons/jeet/issues).
